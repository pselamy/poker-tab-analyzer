# Poker Tab Analyzer - Current Status Summary

## What's Working ✅

1. **Extension Structure**: The Chrome extension builds and loads correctly
2. **Persistence**: Analysis now continues running even when the popup closes
   - State saved to `chrome.storage.local`
   - Content script restores state on page reload
   - Popup syncs with current state when reopened
3. **Build System**: Simple shell scripts for building and testing
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive tests with AAA pattern
5. **Basic UI**: Popup interface and overlay display

## What's NOT Working ❌

1. **Card Detection is Completely Mocked**
   - `recognizeCard()` returns random cards instead of detecting them
   - No actual computer vision implementation
   - This is why the extension appears broken - it's not actually detecting cards

2. **Missing OCR Implementation**
   - Pot size detection returns "0"
   - Player count returns fixed "6"
   - Action buttons return fixed array
   - No text recognition capability

3. **Integration Tests Are Misleading**
   - Only test file existence and basic UI
   - Don't test actual functionality
   - Pass even though core features don't work

## Test Results

- ✅ 12/12 library tests passing
- ✅ 7/8 content persistence tests passing
- ✅ 10/10 popup persistence tests passing  
- ❌ 0/10 computer vision tests passing (need document mock)
- ❌ 1 test failing: interval type validation needs fix

## Key Issues

1. **No Real Computer Vision**: The detector finds white regions but can't identify cards
2. **No OCR Library**: Need Tesseract.js or similar for text recognition
3. **Mock Implementation**: Everything returns hardcoded/random values

## Next Steps

To make this extension actually work:

1. **Implement Real Card Detection**
   - Add template matching for card ranks/suits
   - Or use a pre-trained ML model
   - Or integrate an OCR library

2. **Add OCR for Text**
   - Pot size
   - Button labels
   - Player chip counts

3. **Fix Remaining Tests**
   - Mock `document` for Node.js tests
   - Fix interval validation logic

4. **Add Real Integration Tests**
   - Test with actual poker screenshots
   - Verify correct card detection
   - Check analysis accuracy

## The Truth

**The extension is essentially a UI shell with no working poker analysis functionality.** 
The computer vision and card detection are completely stubbed out with mock implementations.
